Interpretation problems occur, the Wide Web Consortium (W3C) global standard established to determine the validity and how they should be interpreted. The standard has been frequently updated to allow for new developments. The latest HTML 4.01 standard, date of December 1999. Proven yet insufficient to meet the needs of rendering documents and provide interactivity. This subsequently led to additional standards to address gaps, including CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) particularly concerned to ensure accurate and consistent formatting of documents) and JavaScript (which aims to increase the interactivity of documents).<a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">Sources Wiky</a>

TitreIndex1=The utilities & Computer Servers.
applicationTitle1=Before setting up servers, personal computers and isolated use was impractical. The need for a company to acquire a printer for each computer, the difficulty of the exchange of digital information between different computers. Each user must copy the information to a floppy disk and then forward it to the addressee in person.
Presentation1=In 1978 the Research Office of the US defense department, DARPA is considering the possibility of internetworking name - link multiple LANs in a network of networks. DARPA interconnects four servers in four universities in the United States. Five years later, the network connects many universities in the United States.
Presentation1b=The word means a server is not size, but a role played by a device on a computer network. A server can be a computer, or when a minicomputer, a mainframe or a smartphone.

TitreIndex2=The document structure.
applicationTitle2=In computing, markup languages represent a class of specialized languages to make textual information. They use tags, tokens delimiting character sequences in character stream (for example a text file) .The tags establishment to transfer both the structure of the document and its contents. This structure is understandable by a computer program, which enables automated processing of the content.
Presentation2=Use tags, It suffices to frame portions of text with tags to use a feature of language. For example in HTML simply place a word in the &lt;b&gt; and &lt;/b&gt; for it to appear in gras.Un simple text editor and simply define a document.

TitreIndex6=Special characters.
applicationTitle6=The HTML document includes special characters outside the seven-bit ASCII range of two objectives must be considered: the integrity of information, and the browser display universel.Il are several ways to specify the character encoding used in the document. First, the web server can include the character encoding or "charset" in the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Content-Type header.
Presentation6=Telecommunications and computing, a coded character set is a code that combines abstract character of one or more writing systems (like alphabets or primers) used to transcribe natural language with a digital representation for each character of this game, that number may itself have different digital representations.
Presentation6b=In some contexts (especially in communications and in the use of computer data), it is important to distinguish one character repertoire, which is a complete set of abstract characters that a system supports, and coded character set or character encoding that specifies how to represent a character using an integer. <a href="http://htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/entities/latin1.html"> Latin </a>

TitreIndex7=be able to make your website.
applicationTitle7=Today, the Web is accessible via different known or unknown operators (free, Orange, Wanadoo, Bouygues, MagicNet) .Some of these operators allow hosted on the website based on HTML (HyperText Markup Language) .They use the HTTP protocol that allows the client (usually via a web browser) d & acute; access resources by a URL.On sometimes called "website" instead of "web site". The websites may not be available on the internet. A web browser is software, multimedia permetant d & acute; have access to the data via HTTP protocol, but also provides FTP.Ses are often given as a HTML, PHP for the public and JSP, JSF for the private (Professional Establishment)but also ASP for Microsoft.
Presentation7=A website or website (English website, literally &laquo; web site &raquo; in French) is a set of web pages and related resources accessible via a web address. A website is hosted on a web server, itself accessible via an internet or intranet. The website contains texts and multimedia.

TitreIndex8=The Semantic Web o&acute; semantic web.
applicationTitle8=Aiming universal use of the Web, the W3C is working on standards and an independent global standardization of the various tools used by Internet users (computers, software ...). In the same perspective of generalization, these standards must be copyright free and open to all. The formula that generalizes the idea is founder &laquo; lead the Web to fully maximize its potential &raquo;.
Presentation8=The W3C birth at the first international conference of the WWW is concomitant with another strong idea of Tim Berners-Lee, the Semantic Web. At the conference, he explained that &laquo; Web needs semantic &raquo; He seeks to overcome the logic of the hypertext link from the perspective of the Web to the real world by semantics. He thus laid the theoretical foundations of the Web.
Presentationb=The World Wide Web Consortium, abbreviated with the acronym W3C, is a non-profit standards organization, founded in October 1994 charged; to promote the compatibility of the World Wide Web technologies. Consortium (W3C) that promotes common methods for exchanging data.The Semantic Web aims to help emergence of new knowledge based on knowledge already present on the Internet. To achieve this, the Semantic Web is implementing Web data of linking and organizing information on the Internet to simply access the knowledge it already has.
